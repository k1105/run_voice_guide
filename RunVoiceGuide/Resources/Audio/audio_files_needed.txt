Audio files needed for the demo course:

- welcome.mp3 - "Welcome to the start line!"
- checkpoint1.mp3 - "First checkpoint reached"
- checkpoint2.mp3 - "Second checkpoint reached"  
- finish.mp3 - "Finish line ahead!"

Note: These should be short MP3 files (2-3 seconds each) for the demo.
For testing purposes, you can use any MP3 files and rename them accordingly.
